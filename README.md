# trumps-border-wall
Analysis and visualizations of Trump's border wall done for my class, Gov 1360: American Public Opinion.

This project analyzes and creates visualizations for nationwide polling data gathered by my class using the Harvard-Harris
polling system. The raw data from the polls and surveys can be found in the .sav files while code done for analysis and 
visualization creation are found in .R files.
